A gothic fantasy chibi girl standing gracefully in front of an ornate vintage mirror with a dark, intricate gothic frame. She has long, golden-blonde hair styled in high twin-tails with soft curls at the ends. Her expression is confident yet mysterious, with big eyes and a playful smirk. She wears a detailed, long gothic princess-style dress, featuring layers of black and dark purple fabric with lace, ruffles, and elegant embroidery. Around her neck, she wears a velvet choker with a small silver pendant. The background is a lavish, shadowy boudoir-inspired room with deep crimson and purple tones. Dim candlelight creates soft, moody reflections across the room. On the wall behind her, a butterfly-shaped ornament glimmers faintly. The overall atmosphere feels elegant, magical, and dark fantasy, focusing on gothic charm without any suggestive elements. The art style blends cute chibi proportions with high detail and dramatic lighting. Soft 35mm film grain, 8K resolution, portrait aspect ratio (4:5).
