4:5 Cinematic Portrait

Me calmly walking towards the camera, with a huge explosion of fire behind me, debris flying in a blur of motion. Wearing a long black trench coat and sunglasses. Hollywood action hero style but true to the character in the attached image. 35mm film look (not intense, soft), shallow depth of field, intense cinematic lighting but not very realistic.
