Cinematic overhead shot of me standing motionless on a rain-slicked brick sidewalk in Gotham City. Neon-green streetlights cast an eerie glow, reflecting off wet pavement. Dark alleyways frame the scene, the towering gothic skyscrapers looming in the background. Motion-blurred figures rush past, their silhouettes dissolving into the neon haze.

35mm film look. Sh, sharp focus on me, my presence dominates the frame. Dramatic contrast between shadow and green light, creating a noir atmosphere.
