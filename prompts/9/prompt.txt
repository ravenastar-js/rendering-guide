Take an extremely ordinary and unremarkable iPhone selfie, with no clear subject or sense of composition-just a quick accidental snapshot. The photo has slight motion blur and uneven lighting from streetlights or indoor lamps, causing mild overexposure in some areas. The angle is cute and giving the picture a deliberately mediocre feel, as if it was taken absentmindedly while pulling the phone from a pocket. The main character is [uploaded person], and [Freddie Mercury] stands next to [him/her], both caught in a casual, imperfect moment. The background shows a lively los angeles street light at night, with neon lights, traffic, and blurry figures passing by. The overall look is intentionally plain and random, capturing the authentic vibe of a poorly composed, spontaneous iPhone selfie.

Be faithful to the facial features of the attached character.
